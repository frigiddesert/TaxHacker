# TaxHacker Project Handoff - 09-16-2025

## Project Overview

TaxHacker is a Next.js-based financial document processing application that automates invoice and receipt processing through email ingestion and AI-powered categorization. The application uses PostgreSQL for data storage, Prisma for ORM, and integrates with QuickBooks Online.

## Current Status

The application has a critical build failure preventing development server startup. The core email processing functionality has been successfully modernized and tested, but a secondary PDF processing feature is blocking the build.

## Completed Work

### ✅ Email Processing Modernization
- **Issue**: `lib/simple-email-fetch.ts` was using deprecated `imap` package
- **Solution**: Refactored to use modern `ImapFlow` library with async/await patterns
- **Status**: Fully functional, tested with database connectivity

### ✅ Database Infrastructure
- **Setup**: PostgreSQL container running on port 5435 (isolated from other projects)
- **Connection**: Verified working with Prisma migrations applied
- **Scripts**: Updated `npm run dev` to automatically start database

### ✅ Code Quality Improvements
- Removed deprecated dependencies
- Modernized async patterns
- Consolidated email processing logic

## Critical Issue: PDF Processing Build Failure

### Problem Description
The application fails to build with the following error:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.js'
./lib/previews/pdf.ts:13:23
```

### Root Cause
- **Package Version**: `pdfjs-dist@^5.4.149` (latest major version)
- **Breaking Change**: In v5.x, the legacy build import path changed from `pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.js` to `pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.mjs`
- **Impact**: PDF preview generation for uploaded documents is broken

### Affected Code
**File**: `lib/previews/pdf.ts` (lines 12-13)

```typescript
// Current (broken) import
const pdfjs = await import("pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.js")

// Required fix for v5.x
const pdfjs = await import("pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.mjs")
```

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: High - Blocks entire application startup
- **Scope**: PDF preview functionality only (email processing works)
- **Workaround**: Temporarily disable PDF fallback rendering

### Immediate Fix Required
1. Update import path in `lib/previews/pdf.ts` line 13
2. Test PDF upload functionality
3. Verify application builds and runs

### Alternative Solutions
If the import path fix fails:
1. Downgrade `pdfjs-dist` to v4.x (maintains legacy paths)
2. Disable PDF fallback entirely (return empty previews)
3. Implement alternative PDF processing library

## Next Steps for Developer

1. **Immediate**: Fix the pdfjs-dist import path
2. **Test**: Verify PDF upload and preview generation
3. **Validate**: Ensure email processing buttons work end-to-end
4. **Document**: Update any version-specific dependencies

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Email**: IMAP processing with ImapFlow
- **AI**: Multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Google, Mistral)
- **Deployment**: Docker-based with docker-compose

## Key Files to Review
- `lib/simple-email-fetch.ts` - Email processing (✅ fixed)
- `lib/previews/pdf.ts` - PDF processing (❌ needs fix)
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Database setup
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

The core functionality is ready; only the PDF import path needs correction to unblock development.
